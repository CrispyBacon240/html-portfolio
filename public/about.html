    <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My life long dream has been to work in tech, to make a difference in people's lives. 
        It all started when I was approximately 8 years old, curiosity got the best of me,
        at the time I disassembled a broken computer, tinkered around with spare parts from
        another computer and with some miracle, managed to get the broken computer working 
        again, this sparked my curiosity for technology, a flame which has never been 
        extinguished, thus I decided to enroll in the full stack web developer bootcamp
        to pursue my dream.
      </p>

      <p>My end goal after completing the course is to build upon what I have learned, as well
        as to use what I have learned to build and implement applications that can improve
        quality of life for people as well as help solve real world challenges/problems,
        this is but the beginning of a long journey, I am confident after the completion of the course
        I will be in the position to pursue what I hope to achieve
